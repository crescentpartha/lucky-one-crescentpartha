# Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity in nth-check (`Fix vulnerabilities`)

- [Help, npm audit says I have a vulnerability in react-scripts!](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/11174 "facebook/create-react-app - github")
- [github Dependabot alert: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity in nth-check](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71282206/github-dependabot-alert-inefficient-regular-expression-complexity-in-nth-check "stackoverflow.com")

## `Solutions`

`npm audit` says there's a warning about ___vulnerabilities___ in my project
Open `package.json`. You will find this:

``` JSON
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^17.0.2",
    "react-dom": "^17.0.2",
    "react-scripts": "4.0.3"
  }
```

Take `react-scripts` and move it to `devDependencies` (if you **don't have** it, **create it**):

``` JSON
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^17.0.2",
    "react-dom": "^17.0.2"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "react-scripts": "4.0.3"
  },
```

Then, ensure you run `npm audit --production` rather than `npm audit`.

This will fix your warnings.
